For 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18, we had to contact OIR over email to get datasets
* All the data we used can be found in our Webstorm Project code (in the folder called “data”). We also have Google Sheets versions of our data in our “General Project GDrive Folder” linked above.

About the Code:
/Images
We cite all the images we use in the html (right before their source tags).
We also have screenshots of sketches that correspond to our original visualization in this folder. (We originally used them as placeholders).
/CSS
Ours: styles.css; All others are not ours and are cited at the beginning of the file
/JS 
Files and code are generally cited as needed.
Our visualizations are coded mainly in the following files:
genderBarChart.js - “A Decade of SEAS Undergrads”
sunburst.js - “Breakdown of SEAS Undergrads in 2018”
stackarea.js - “SEAS vs College Concentrations Over Time”
slopegraph.js and slopegraph2.js - “SEAS vs FAS Slope Charts”
Additionally, we initialize our “fullpage” layout (using fullpage.js which is not ours and is cited as such) in a file we created called layout-setup.js (which adapts code from the “fullpage” documentation and we cite this).
